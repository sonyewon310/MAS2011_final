# Snack Time!

 My final project is called “Snack Time!”. This is a 1 person shooting game, but not shooting bullets but some snacks!

1. Main

 When you start the pygame file, the main screen will lead you to start the game. Press any key to start the game. 

2. Start

 Now, you can see a player icon, which is a finger pointing upside. With this finger, you can shoot some snacks toward the mouth, which is in the top of the screen.

3. Goal

 The goal of this game is to get more than 1000 scores. When you shoot a snack exactly to the mouth, you can get 50 scores. 

4. Obstacle

 However, you have to avoid germs. When the germ hit a player, you will lose 1 life, which you have 5 in original. When the snack you shot hit the germ, you will lose your shield and 30 scores. However, when this happens, a medicine or capsule randomly fall down, which will help you to recover your shield. 

5. Assets

 I tried to use cute, charming images and sounds for people of all ages can play. It is simple game to play and not hard to reach the goal. 

6. Enjoy!
