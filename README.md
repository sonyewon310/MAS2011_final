Snack Time!

My final project is called “Snack Time!”. This is a 1 person shooting game, but not shooting bullets but some snacks!
<Main>
When you start the pygame file, the main screen will lead you to start the game. Press any key to start the game. 
<Start>
Now, you can see a player icon, which is a finger pointing upside. With this finger, you can shoot some snacks toward the mouth, which is in the top of the screen.
<Goal>
The goal of this game is to get more than 1000 scores. When you shoot a snack exactly to the mouth, you can get 50 scores. 
<Obstacle>
However, you have to avoid germs. When the germ hit a player, you will lose 1 life, which you have 5 in original. When the snack you shot hit the germ, you will lose your shield and 30 scores. However, when this happens, a medicine or capsule randomly fall down, which will help you to recover your shield. 
<Assets>
I tried to use cute, charming images and sounds for people of all ages can play. It is simple game to play and not hard to reach the goal.
